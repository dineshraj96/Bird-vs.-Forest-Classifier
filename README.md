# Bird-vs.-Forest-Classifier
This project is a beginner-friendly deep learning model built using FastAI and PyTorch in Google Colab. The model classifies images as either Bird or Forest, making it a simple but practical introduction to computer vision and transfer learning.

ðŸ”¹ Tech stack: FastAI, PyTorch, Google Colab

ðŸ”¹ Features:

  Image classification (Bird vs. Forest)
  
  Transfer learning with pretrained models
  
  Training, validation, and testing workflow

Exported model for inference

This repository is my first step into the world of deep learning projects, and I plan to expand it with more datasets, improved accuracy, and deployment experiments.
